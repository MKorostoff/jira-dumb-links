This plugin does not collect or store any user data of any kind. It does not collect personal data, it does not collect anonymized data, it does not collect aggregated data, it does not collect data, period. I literally don't even know if anyone is using this plugin, because there is no data storage. Because no data is ever collected, no data is ever transfered, sold, or disclosed to any third parties. If aliens flew down from outerspace and trapped me in a nutritive brine liquid where ever second was a thousand years and tortured me forever until I give them access to your data I still couldn't do it because I *don't have it.*
